# Cubee
![](https://github.com/jsamfaub/Cubee/blob/master/data/cubee%20logo.png)
Cubee (pronounced Kyu-bay) is an experimental game prototype made with C++ and SDL2 to test different features of SDL2.
I do plan to make it a somewhat full game some time in the future.
# Custom Levels
You modify the level1.lvl file in the data/levels/ folder to make a custom level.
Zeros ('0') represent empty spaces,
Hashtags ('#') represent blocks,
And Ns ('n') are used to seperate every horizontal line (so there's one at the end of every line except the last).
The height and width of the level will be calculated automatically based on this file.
Have fun with this feature!
